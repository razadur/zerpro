The tried and true tactics of old (direct mail, email blasts, cold calls) simply weren’t effective anymore.</p>

We’ll admit, we were surprised. </span><strong>How had this tiny blog with no budget generated more traffic than companies with professional marketing teams and way bigger budgets?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It felt like a modern-day David versus Goliath.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>

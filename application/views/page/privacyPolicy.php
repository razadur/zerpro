                    <p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-account">ZerproAccount</a>, we can make those services even better – to show you <a class="highlight highlight-unselected" href="../../policies/privacy/example/more-relevant-search-results.html" id="more-relevant-search-results">more relevant search results</a> and ads, to help you <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/connect-with-people.html" id="connect-with-people">connect with people</a> or to make <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/sharing-with-others.html" id="sharing-with-others">sharing with others quicker and easier</a>. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
                    <p>Our Privacy Policy explains:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What information we collect and why we collect it.
                        <li>How we use that information.
                        <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</ul>
                    <p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/">key terms</a> first. Your privacy matters to Zerproso whether you are new to Zerproor a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions <a href="https://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/2990837?hl=en">contact us</a>.

We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
                    <p>We may use the name you provide for your ZerproProfile across all of the services we offer that require a ZerproAccount. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your ZerproAccount so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible ZerproProfile information, such as your name and photo.
                    <p>If you have a ZerproAccount, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Zerproor on third-party applications connected to your ZerproAccount (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings.html" id="limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings">limit sharing or visibility settings</a> in your ZerproAccount.
                    <p>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
                    <p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-pixel">pixel tags</a>, to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/improve-your-user-experience.html" id="improve-your-user-experience">improve your user experience</a> and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is ZerproAnalytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</a>, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
                    <p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.

                    <p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:
                    <ul>

If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
                    <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
                    <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
